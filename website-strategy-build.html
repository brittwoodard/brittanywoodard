    <p>Maybe it’s a DIY site you started years ago. Maybe it’s a beautiful template that doesn't actually "talk" to your CRM. Or maybe it’s just a digital business card that isn't capturing leads while you sleep.</p>
    <p>You’re tired of saying "ignore the website, just use this direct link" or worrying that a potential high-level client will drop off because the mobile experience is clunky.</p>
  description-right_html: |
    <p class="mt-4 md:mt-0">A website shouldn't just be an expense; it should be your most active team member.</p>
    <p>It’s the bridge between someone discovering your work and someone becoming a lifelong client. If that bridge is shaky, you’re losing more than just clicks, you’re losing the opportunity to scale without working more hours.</p>
desires: 
  heading_html: Imagine a digital space that <em>feels as intentional as the wellness programs you lead</em>.
  description_html: |
    <p>Where every button has a purpose, every form flows into an automation, and the design tells your story before a client even reads the first paragraph.</p>
    <p>I don't just build pages; I build a journey. From intentional details to high-converting layouts, I ensure your site is a scalable asset that grows with you.</p>

faq:
  heading_html: Frequently Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: What platforms do you work with?
     answer_html: I'm not tied to a single platform. I’ll recommend tools based on how your business operates, your goals, and your budget. In many cases, we optimise what you’re already using. If a migration makes sense, we’ll guide that too.
   - question: Will I need to migrate everything to a specific platform?
     answer_html: No. A full migration is never required to work together. Sometimes it’s the right move, sometimes it isn’t. We’ll talk it through and make a recommendation based on what will support your business long-term.
   - question: How long does the process take?
     answer_html: It depends on scope, but most projects run between one and three months. You’ll have a clear timeline before we begin.
   - question: Will this work with my existing website?
     answer_html: In most cases, yes. We integrate forms, flows, and automations directly into your current site. If your website is limiting what you want to do, we’ll be upfront about that.
   - question: What happens after the project is complete?
     answer_html: You’ll have fully tested systems in place, along with documentation where it’s helpful. You may continue working with me for ongoing systems support, but there’s no obligation.
   - question: Is this a good fit if I’m just starting out?
     answer_html: Yes. Setting up your systems early saves time and stress later, and gives your business a stronger foundation as it grows.
