    <p>Maybe it’s a DIY site you started years ago. Maybe it’s a beautiful template that doesn't actually "talk" to your CRM. Or maybe it’s just a digital business card that isn't capturing leads while you sleep.</p>
    <p>You’re tired of saying "ignore the website, just use this direct link" or worrying that a potential high-level client will drop off because the mobile experience is clunky.</p>

    <p class="mt-4 md:mt-0">A website shouldn't just be an expense; it should be your most active team member.</p>
    <p>It’s the bridge between someone discovering your work and someone becoming a lifelong client. If that bridge is shaky, you’re losing more than just clicks, you’re losing the opportunity to scale without working more hours.</p>

    <p>Where every button has a purpose, every form flows into an automation, and the design tells your story before a client even reads the first paragraph.</p>
    <p>I don't just build pages; I build a journey. From intentional details to high-converting layouts, I ensure your site is a scalable asset that grows with you.</p>

faq:
  heading_html: Frequently Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: Which website platform do you use?
     answer_html: I specialize in building custom-coded websites. Unlike template-based platforms like Wix or WordPress, custom-coded sites aren't limited by what a plugin or a theme allows you to do. They are built entirely around your unique business needs. While I can work with other platforms if it truly makes sense for your project, I prefer the custom approach because it results in a faster, more secure, and more scalable site that won't break as your business evolves.
   - question: How long does a website build take?
     answer_html: Most custom builds take between 4 and 8 weeks, depending on the number of pages and the complexity of your integrations. We’ll establish a clear timeline before we start so you know exactly when to plan your launch.
   - question: Do I need to have my systems (CRM, email, etc.) set up first?
     answer_html: Not necessarily. If you’re already using tools you love, I’ll integrate them. If you’re starting from scratch, I can recommend the best tools for your workflow as part of the build.
   - question: Is SEO included in the build?
     answer_html: Yes. Every site includes an on-page SEO framework, including optimized meta-data, site structure, and fast loading speeds to give you a solid foundation for search engine rankings from day one.
