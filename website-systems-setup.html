    <p>People want to work with you. They’re excited. They ask how to join. And then...</p>

    <p>So you stay glued to your laptop, while your marketing efforts bring in disappointing results.</p>
    <p>Your systems don’t match your expertise… and you feel it. You’re ready to get your business automated so that you can get back to doing what you love.</p>
