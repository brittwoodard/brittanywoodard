  heading_html: Frequently Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: What platforms do you work with?
     answer_html: I'm not tied to a single platform. I’ll recommend tools based on how your business operates, your goals, and your budget. In many cases, we optimise what you’re already using. If a migration makes sense, we’ll guide that too.
   - question: Will I need to migrate everything to a specific platform?
     answer_html: No. A full migration is never required to work together. Sometimes it’s the right move, sometimes it isn’t. We’ll talk it through and make a recommendation based on what will support your business long-term.
   - question: How long does the process take?
     answer_html: It depends on scope, but most projects run between one and three months. You’ll have a clear timeline before we begin.
   - question: Will this work with my existing website?
     answer_html: In most cases, yes. We integrate forms, flows, and automations directly into your current site. If your website is limiting what you want to do, we’ll be upfront about that.
   - question: What happens after the project is complete?
     answer_html: You’ll have fully tested systems in place, along with documentation where it’s helpful. You may continue working with me for ongoing systems support, but there’s no obligation.
   - question: Is this a good fit if I’m just starting out?
     answer_html: Yes. Setting up your systems early saves time and stress later, and gives your business a stronger foundation as it grows.
