    <p>People want to work with you. They’re excited. They ask how to join. What the next step is. When they can get started. And then...</p>
    <p>Invoices go out manually. Follow-ups slip through the cracks. A few clients make it through. But many disappear before they ever say yes.</p>
    <p>You’re stuck double-checking who’s paid, sending scattered emails, and trying to remember who still needs onboarding.</p>
    <p>Your backend is all over the place. Your systems don’t talk to each other. And you feel it—not just in your calendar, but in your body.</p>
  description-right_html: |
    <p class="mt-4 md:mt-0">You’re overwhelmed, behind, and spending more time reacting than creating.</p>
    <p>All while your marketing is finally gaining traction... but without the infrastructure to support it. It’s like pouring water into a leaky bucket.</p>
    <p>You didn’t start your business to be tech support. You started it to help people. To guide them. To do meaningful work.</p>
    <p>Your business doesn't match your expertise, and you feel it. You’re ready to get your business automated so that you can get back to doing what you love.</p>

faq:
  heading_html: Frequently Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: What platforms do you work with?
     answer_html: I'm not tied to a single platform. I’ll recommend tools based on how your business operates, your goals, and your budget. In many cases, we optimise what you’re already using. If a migration makes sense, we’ll guide that too.
   - question: Will I need to migrate everything to a specific platform?
     answer_html: No. A full migration is never required to work together. Sometimes it’s the right move, sometimes it isn’t. We’ll talk it through and make a recommendation based on what will support your business long-term.
   - question: How long does the process take?
     answer_html: It depends on scope, but most projects run between one and three months. You’ll have a clear timeline before we begin.
   - question: Will this work with my existing website?
     answer_html: In most cases, yes. We integrate forms, flows, and automations directly into your current site. If your website is limiting what you want to do, we’ll be upfront about that.
   - question: What happens after the project is complete?
     answer_html: You’ll have fully tested systems in place, along with documentation where it’s helpful. You may continue working with me for ongoing systems support, but there’s no obligation.
   - question: Is this a good fit if I’m just starting out?
     answer_html: Yes. Setting up your systems early saves time and stress later, and gives your business a stronger foundation as it grows.
